# 🎮 Quantum Pong with Gate Power-Ups

A creative fusion of **classic Pong** and **quantum mechanics** — built with **Python** and **Pygame**, this game introduces players to quantum concepts like **superposition**, **quantum gates**, and **measurement collapse** through fast-paced, arcade-style gameplay.

---

## 🧠 Concept

This game reimagines Pong with a quantum twist:

- The ball can exist in **superposition**, appearing as two balls at once.
- Quantum gates (**X**, **Z**, **H**) can be applied manually or via falling power-ups.
- Upon measurement or paddle collision, the ball **collapses** to a definite state (`|0⟩` or `|1⟩`).
- Quantum effects like **Z-noise** (decoherence) and **quantum tunneling** (jerk + direction flip) enhance unpredictability.

---

## 🎮 How to Play

### Controls:
- `↑` / `↓` — Move player paddle
- `H` — Apply Hadamard Gate (superposition)
- `X` — Apply X Gate (bit flip)
- `Z` — Apply Z Gate (phase flip)

### Power-Ups:
- Appear randomly and float downwards.
- Colliding with a power-up triggers the respective quantum gate.

| Feature            | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Superposition**  | Dual balls move in parallel paths using Hadamard gate                      |
| **Collapse**       | Randomly collapses to `|0⟩` or `|1⟩` on contact or timeout                  |
| **Quantum Gates**  | X, Z, and H gates manually applied or collected via power-ups              |
| **Z-Noise**        | Simulates quantum decoherence by flipping direction randomly               |
| **Quantum Jerk**   | Speed + direction changes mimic tunneling upon state transitions           |
